## 9. Current Progress Summary

Our implementation has successfully addressed the core technical aspects of the project, particularly the federated learning approach for cervical cancer detection. The federated learning implementation shows promising results, outperforming the centralized approach with:
- Federated Learning: 72.03% accuracy, 81.61% precision, 74.74% recall, 78.02% F1 score
- Centralized Learning: 67.13% accuracy, 79.27% precision, 68.42% recall, 73.45% F1 score

The cross-validation results also demonstrate the robustness of the model with a mean accuracy of 72.33% (±6.55%) and AUC of 78.06% (±4.57%).

The next phase should focus on clinical validation, deployment considerations, and comprehensive documentation to complete the thesis requirements.
